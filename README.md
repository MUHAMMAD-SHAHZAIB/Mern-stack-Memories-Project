# Mern Stack Memories Project
The Mern Stack Memories Project is a simple and beginner-friendly project. It consists of two folders: "client" and "server." In the client folder, the frontend is designed using React. In the server folder, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB are used. I explain this project step by step

# Step By Step Explanation


# 1) Client Side

* In the client-side, I first created an API file where I added methods for AddPost, EditPost, DeletePost, and LikePost.
* I created a Redux file where I defined all the functionalities for storing data. I defined how to store data in Redux.
* In the component files, I created PostForm and Posts files where I defined the functionalities for handling the post form and displaying posts. I designed how to handle the post form and how to send data to the database.

# 2) Server Side
* In the index file, I established the connectivity between the database and the server. Additionally, I created a method for handling CORS policy.
* I utilized a microservices architecture for creating the project on the server-side.
* In the controller file, I defined the functionalities for API operations such as posting, deleting, updating, linking posts, and getting posts.
* In the model file, I designed the schema structure for the database.
* In the router file, I designed the routing for the API endpoints, linking them to their respective functionalities.
